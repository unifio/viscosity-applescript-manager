## Viscosity VPN Connection Management via AppleScript

Just a simple AppleScript I wrote out of frustration with being unable to manage my Viscosity VPN connections when I disconnected my external monitor.

Unfortunately Viscosity does not provide a way in OSX to manage your connections outside of the Menu Bar UI, at least not that I have found. If you have a ton of items in your Menu Bar like I do there is a good chance it won't be visible at all times. 

You can use this simple script to get a list of your connections and connect or disconnect them in the absence of the Viscosity Menu Bar item.
